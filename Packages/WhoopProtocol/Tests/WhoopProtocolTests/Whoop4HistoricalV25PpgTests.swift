/// WHOOP 4.0 **v25** PPG → HR feasibility guard (issue #194, RFC — NOT a live decode).
/// Reimplemented from @vulnix0x4's PR #307 (RFC for #194); the disproof + retraction are @ryanbr's.
///
/// #194 proposed reading the v25 record's optical PPG waveform on an odd byte grid and routing it through
/// the existing `PpgHr` lane to recover HR (the way v26/WHOOP-5 does). The original evidence was "60 bpm
/// on 3 resting sessions". @ryanbr then **withdrew** that result: concatenating N samples/record before
/// autocorrelating manufactures a self-similarity at lag = N, which peaks at `60·fs/N` (= 60 bpm at
/// fs=N=24) *regardless of the real HR* — it reports the record PERIOD, not physiology. We accepted this,
/// audited the shipped v26 lane for the same trap, and added the boundary-gated
/// `PpgHr.removeRecordRateComponent` notch (v2.8.6).
///
/// This test PINS that finding against the three REAL v25 frames already in the repo
/// (`Whoop4HistoricalV25Tests`), and documents two facts a future v25-PPG decoder must respect:
///
///   1. **The bare-autocorrelation "60 bpm" is the concatenation artifact.** At the start offset where
///      ryanbr saw it (15), varying samples-per-record N makes the reported bpm track `1440/N` EXACTLY
///      (16→90 … 24→60 … 30→48) — the record period 60·fs/N, with no stable pulse underneath.
///
///   2. **The v2.8.6 notch does NOT fully neutralise this artifact, so the START BYTE is load-bearing.**
///      Fed through the SHIPPED `PpgHr.derivePpgHr` lane, the #194-proposed span (start 25, before
///      gravity@73) yields NO HR — good — but the SAME lane reading from offset 15 still emits a
///      fabricated 60 bpm at conf ≈ 0.32, because there the per-record waveforms are near-identical
///      (the slow unix tail) so the boundary discontinuity the notch keys on never fires. A v25 decoder
///      that picked a start a few bytes off — entirely possible while the exact span is unpinned — would
///      ship plausible-but-wrong HR. That is precisely why this stays held pending a non-resting,
///      multi-strap, known-HR-≠-60 corpus (#194), and why this guard is executable rather than prose.
///
/// It does NOT wire v25 into the live HR lane.
