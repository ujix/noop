/// Haptic Clock (#460): turn a wall-clock time into a deterministic list of wrist buzzes so a user
/// can read the time off the strap without looking at a screen — a long pulse counts tens, a short
/// pulse counts units, in the order hour-tens, hour-units, minute-tens, minute-units.
///
/// This is a PURE, platform-agnostic encoder: time-in, pulse-list-out, no I/O and no BLE. The trigger
/// (`BLEManager.buzzTimeNow()` on Apple, `WhoopBleClient.buzzTimeNow()` on Android) walks the list and
/// fires each pulse through the EXISTING maverick notification buzz; only the *schedule* of buzzes is
/// new, the buzz itself is the hardware-confirmed one. The Kotlin twin is
/// `android/app/src/main/java/com/noop/protocol/HapticClock.kt`; the two pulse lists are pinned
/// identical by matching unit tests on both platforms (e.g. 3:25 → the same list).
///
/// Reading the buzzes:
///   • LONG pulse  = one "ten"   in the current digit group
///   • SHORT pulse = one "unit"  in the current digit group
///   • a short gap separates pulses; a long gap separates the four digit groups (HH-tens, HH-units,
///     MM-tens, MM-units); an extra-long gap separates the hour block from the minute block.
///   • a digit of 0 emits NO pulse — the group is signalled only by the surrounding group gaps, so
///     e.g. 10:05 is [long](ten-hour) · gap · (no hour-units) · BLOCK · (no min-tens) · gap · short×5.
