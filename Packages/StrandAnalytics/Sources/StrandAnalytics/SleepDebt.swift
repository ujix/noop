// SleepDebt.swift — a rolling sleep-debt ledger over the last N nights.
//
// Pure, deterministic, DB-free. Given a chronological series of per-night total
// sleep (minutes) and a personal sleep need (hours), it accumulates a running
// balance of (actual − need) per night across a capped trailing window (14 nights
// by default) and reports the net balance plus the per-night deltas that make it
// up.
//
// HONEST by construction:
//   - It is a plain debt accumulator — sum of nightly (slept − need) — NOT a
//     physiological model. A surplus night (slept > need) genuinely offsets a
//     deficit one, the same way a checking balance nets credits and debits.
//   - The window is capped (default 14) so "debt" never compounds indefinitely
//     across months of history — only the recent fortnight is in scope.
//   - Nights with no usable sleep total are SKIPPED entirely (no zero-fill), so a
//     gap in wear never reads as a full night of debt.
//   - The need value is supplied by the caller (AnalyticsEngine.Rest.defaultNeedHours
//     = 8.0 by default; the caller passes any personal override). Computation here
//     stays a pure function of (series, need, window).
//
// Constant-explicit + dependency-free so the Kotlin mirror (android … SleepDebt.kt)
// is byte-identical.
