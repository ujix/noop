# update-homebrew-cask.sh <version>  —  refresh the Homebrew cask after a macOS release.
#
# Run this as the last step of cutting a macOS release (after the release zip is built and
# uploaded). It computes the zip's SHA256, regenerates Casks/noop.rb in NoopApp/homebrew-noop,
# and pushes it — so `brew upgrade --cask noop` picks up the new version. Users install/update with:
#     brew tap noopapp/noop && brew trust noopapp/noop && brew install --cask noop
#     brew upgrade --cask noop
# (brew trust is a one-time per-machine step required since Homebrew 6.0.0 for non-official taps.)
#
# Anonymity-safe: commits as NoopApp; the token (NoopApp PAT at ~/.config/noop/gh_token) is read
# from the file and supplied through a transient git credential helper, so it is NEVER placed on a
# command line, in a remote URL, or in any output. The PAT must have Contents:write on homebrew-noop.
#
# Usage:  Tools/update-homebrew-cask.sh 1.94   [optional: path to the zip]
