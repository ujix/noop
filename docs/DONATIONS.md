# Donations (optional)

**NOOP is free, and it stays free. Nothing here is a paywall.**

NOOP is a standalone, fully offline companion app for WHOOP straps (4.0 and
5.0). It pairs directly with the strap over Bluetooth, stores everything on your
own device in SQLite, imports your existing WHOOP CSV and Apple Health history,
and computes recovery, strain, HRV, and sleep locally, with no WHOOP account and
no cloud. That includes every feature: live data, breathing
biofeedback, the haptic interval timer, automations, importing your whole
history, and all of the analytics. There is no "pro" tier, no trial, no locked
screen, and no nag. The app never asks you to pay to do anything.

This page exists only because people kept asking how to chip in. If it's useful
to you and you *want* to, you can. If you don't, nothing changes, and you'll
never be asked twice. The same addresses are shown in-app
under the **Support** screen, each with a scan-to-donate QR code.

**Honestly, though — if you can, please do.** Keeping NOOP free, anonymous, and
off the cloud means there's no company and no investor behind it, just one person
covering the bills out of pocket. A little support genuinely
decides whether a Windows build happens, and whether the macOS, Android, and iOS
apps keep getting better, and it's the
difference between this being a one-off and an ongoing thing. **Crypto is the
only way to contribute, on purpose:** staying anonymous rules out PayPal,
Patreon, or anything with a name attached. That's not a hurdle — it's quick,
global, and private for both of us.

## Why donate at all?

You don't have to, and the project is built so you never need to. But the work
is ongoing and unpaid, and donations go toward more of it:

- **A Windows build** — bringing the same offline, local-first experience to PC;
  it's the next target after macOS, Android, and iOS.
- **More features and polish** — deeper analytics, broader strap coverage, and
  improvements to the existing screens across macOS, Android, and iOS.
- **Test hardware and time** — straps, devices, and the hours to keep the
  reverse-engineering work current as firmware changes.

Donations are a thank-you, not a transaction. Nothing about the app, your data,
or your access depends on them.

## New to crypto? Here's the 2-minute version

You don't need to "be into crypto" to chip in:

1. **Install a mainstream exchange app** — Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, or **Cash App**
   (Cash App buys/sends Bitcoin directly, no extra app).
2. **Buy some Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH)** — a suggested **$50+** (a fraction of a year's WHOOP subscription); anything is appreciated, but $50+ is what keeps the project going.
   You can usually pay with a debit card or bank transfer.
3. **Tap Send / Withdraw**, paste the matching address below, and confirm.

That's the whole thing. A few notes so nothing goes wrong:

- **Only ever send a coin to its own network** (BTC to the BTC address, ETH to the ETH
  address, etc.). Sending across networks can lose the funds.
- **Copy the address in full** and double-check the **first and last few characters** —
  transactions are irreversible.
- Exchanges charge a small network/withdrawal fee; that's normal and goes to the network,
  not us. Sending a slightly larger amount once beats many tiny transfers.
- In the app's **Support** screen, each address has a **QR code** — point your exchange
  app's "scan" at it instead of copy-pasting.

## Addresses

All four are standard receiving addresses on their respective networks. Pick
whichever you already hold — there's no preference. **Always copy the address in
full and double-check the first and last characters before sending.** Crypto
transactions are irreversible, and only ever send a coin to its matching network.

| Coin | Network | Address |
|---|---|---|
| **BTC** | Bitcoin | `bc1qn2gkl7wslwpws06mvazjn2uu689zlkv7kg3kf5` |
| **ADA** | Cardano | `addr1qxsju3y0mlke2h6h2g6qgnq4r3jstngtyjxs0nnp5zrv28zv8p5rgzruxyjz33j9k23pffta8z639e2snjdd4vcetfqsn4vwr3` |
| **ETH** | Ethereum | `0xd64D508b531c4b1297Ca4023C774e0E97aA67B7F` |
| **XRP** | XRP Ledger | `rpvijHi2nVY9WWAJhojsAX5tJmHdmLtFhq` |
| **USDT** | (ERC20, BEP20) | `0x5f570f5d2294218c09eada7fa34b0acd645b0958` | (this fork)

## What donations are *not*

- **Not a subscription.** One-off, whenever you like, never recurring.
- **Not required.** Every feature works fully without paying anything.
- **Not a license.** You don't owe anything to use, fork, or build NOOP — see
  [`../ATTRIBUTION.md`](../ATTRIBUTION.md) for the upstream community work it stands on.
- **Not tied to your data.** NOOP has no server and no account. There is nothing
  to "unlock" and no record of who has or hasn't donated.

If you'd rather contribute without money, that's just as welcome: open an issue,
file a bug, send a pull request, or help test on hardware you own. That kind of
help moves the project forward as much as anything.

**Questions, feedback, or bug reports:** [thenoopapp@gmail.com](mailto:thenoopapp@gmail.com)

## A note on the project

NOOP is built on prior community reverse-engineering — chiefly
[`johnmiddleton12/my-whoop`](https://github.com/johnmiddleton12/my-whoop) (WHOOP
4.0 protocol) and [`b-nnett/goose`](https://github.com/b-nnett/goose) (WHOOP 5.0
protocol). It exists so that someone who owns a WHOOP strap can read their own
biometric data from their own device, on a machine they control. Keeping it free
and unpaywalled is the whole point. Donations help, but the project's promise —
your strap, your data, your machine — never has a price tag attached.

Thank you for even reading this far.
