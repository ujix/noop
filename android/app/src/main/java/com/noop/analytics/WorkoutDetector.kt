/*
 * WorkoutDetector.kt — retroactive workout detection from the 1 Hz store.
 *
 * Faithful Kotlin port of StrandAnalytics/WorkoutDetector.swift (verified on macOS),
 * itself ported from server/ingest/app/analysis/exercise.py (+ activity.py, calories.py).
 *
 * A workout is a SUSTAINED window (≥ MIN_EXERCISE_MIN) of elevated HR (above
 * resting + HR_MARGIN_BPM) AND sustained motion (gravity-derived intensity above
 * MOTION_THRESHOLD). Both gates must hold for a sample to count as active.
 *
 * Per detected bout: avg/peak HR, duration, Edwards zone time-%, mean %HRR,
 * strain (StrainScorer), and estimated calories (Keytel 2005 active + revised
 * Harris–Benedict BMR resting, age/sex/weight/height adjusted).
 *
 * All intensity/energy outputs are APPROXIMATE and not medical advice.
 *
 * Types note: [UserProfile], [ExerciseSession] and [ActivityPoint] live in
 * AnalyticsModels.kt (shared value types) and are NOT redefined here. Inputs are
 * the Room entities com.noop.data.HrSample (ts:Long seconds, bpm:Int) and
 * com.noop.data.GravitySample (ts:Long seconds, x/y/z:Double). All `ts`/`start`/`end`
 * are unix SECONDS as Long. The Swift source used Int seconds.

     * APPROXIMATE whole-day total energy estimate (kcal) from the full day's HR
     * samples. Per-second model: below the day activeThreshold (resting +
     * [dayActiveHRRFraction] HRR) a sample burns the resting BMR rate, above it the
     * Keytel active rate — FLOORED at the resting rate so a day-second can never be
     * credited LESS than resting metabolism.
     *
     * The day path uses [dayActiveHRRFraction] (50% HRR), NOT the 30% the bout detector
     * uses ([activeHRRFraction]). The Keytel 2005 equation is validated for genuine
     * EXERCISE HR; at 30% the gate falls to ~94 bpm for a typical user, so ordinary
     * low-intensity daytime HR (walking, stairs, standing) credited the full
     * gross-exercise rate across the whole day and over-counted by ~1000+ kcal
     * (community "Calories too high"). The 50% gate keeps the gross rate for genuine
     * exercise-level HR only; the bout path is UNCHANGED — Keytel is appropriate there,
     * on a real detected/manual workout.
     *
     * Each HR sample = ONE second of data (1 Hz strap), counted flat — this path
     * deliberately does NOT use the bout estimator's elapsed-time-per-sample weighting.
     * The day feed is a raw, non-gap-filled union of the day's HR (it is NOT motion-gated
     * the way a bout is), so capping each gap at mergeGapS (150 s) would credit up to
     * ~150 s of active burn to a single isolated elevated sample — over-counting by ~150x
     * on gappy days. Flat one-second-per-sample is the conservative, stable choice for the
     * day total. This is an on-device estimate from heart rate alone — NOT laboratory
     * calorimetry, NOT Apple/WHOOP cloud parity, NOT medical advice.
     *
     * @param hrSamples the whole day's HR samples (one second each).
