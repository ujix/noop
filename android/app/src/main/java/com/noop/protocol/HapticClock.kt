/**
 * Haptic Clock (#460): turn a wall-clock time into a deterministic list of wrist buzzes so a user can
 * read the time off the strap without looking at a screen — a long pulse counts tens, a short pulse
 * counts units, in the order hour-tens, hour-units, minute-tens, minute-units.
 *
 * This is a PURE, platform-agnostic encoder: time-in, pulse-list-out, no I/O and no BLE. The trigger
 * ([com.noop.ble.WhoopBleClient.buzzTimeNow]) walks the list and fires each pulse through the EXISTING
 * maverick notification buzz; only the *schedule* of buzzes is new, the buzz itself is the
 * hardware-confirmed one. Kotlin twin of the Apple `HapticClock.swift`; the two pulse lists are pinned
 * identical by matching unit tests on both platforms (e.g. 3:25 → the same list).
 *
 * Reading the buzzes:
 *  - LONG pulse  = one "ten"   in the current digit group
 *  - SHORT pulse = one "unit"  in the current digit group
 *  - a short gap separates pulses; a long gap separates the four digit groups (HH-tens, HH-units,
 *    MM-tens, MM-units); an extra-long gap separates the hour block from the minute block.
 *  - a digit of 0 emits NO pulse — the group is signalled only by the surrounding group gaps.
